### MERN Stack Full-Stack Development Roadmap

**Program Title:** MERN Stack Full-Stack Development Program    

## **Program Objective**
This program is designed to take students from fundamentals to production-level full-stack development. The roadmap follows an industry-aligned learning path, emphasizes weekly practical tasks, and concludes with 4 weeks of real-time individual full-stack project development using **MERN + PostgreSQL** with proper **MVC architecture**.  

---

## **Starting Point (Foundational Path)**

Students will progress in the following structured order:

1. **Programming Fundamentals – C++ (OOP)**  
   - Learn the basics of programming using C++  
   - Object-Oriented Programming concepts: classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation  
   - Variables, data types, operators, loops, functions, and recursion  

2. **Frontend Basics – HTML, CSS**  
   - Structure web pages with HTML  
   - Style web pages using CSS  

3. **UI Frameworks – Bootstrap, Tailwind CSS**  
   - Build responsive and visually appealing interfaces  

4. **Frontend Libraries – React.js / Next.js**  
   - Create dynamic single-page applications  
   - Understand component-based architecture  

5. **State Management – Redux Toolkit**  
   - Manage application state efficiently  

6. **Backend Development – Node.js, Express.js**  
   - Build server-side applications  
   - Implement APIs for frontend integration  

7. **Database – PostgreSQL (PgSQL)**  
   - Store and manage structured data  
   - Write queries for CRUD operations  

8. **Architecture – MVC Pattern**  
   - Understand and implement Model-View-Controller architecture for scalable apps  

9. **Full-Stack CRUD Applications**  
   - Connect frontend with backend and database  
   - Perform Create, Read, Update, Delete operations  

10. **Real-Time Individual Project (4 Weeks)**  
    - Apply all skills in a production-level full-stack project  
    - Use MERN + PostgreSQL with proper MVC architecture
