### # Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in C++

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that organizes code around **objects** rather than just functions or logic. Objects represent real-world entities and contain both **data** (attributes) and **functions** (methods) that operate on the data.  

OOP makes programs easier to **understand, maintain, and reuse**.

## **Key Concepts of OOP**

1. **Class**  
   - A blueprint for creating objects.  
   - Defines the **attributes** (data members) and **methods** (functions) that the objects will have.  

   ```cpp
   class Car {
   public:
       string brand;
       int year;

       void start() {
           cout << brand << " car started." << endl;
       }
   };
