## **1. Introduction to Programming**
Programming is the process of giving instructions to a computer to perform tasks. C++ is a powerful, high-level programming language that allows you to write programs ranging from simple console applications to complex systems.  

Key points about programming in C++:  
- Allows procedural, object-oriented, and generic programming.  
- Compiled language, which means the code is converted into machine language before running.  
- Popular for system programming, game development, and competitive programming.

## **2. C++ Syntax & Structure**
A basic C++ program has the following structure:

```cpp
#include <iostream> // Include library for input/output

using namespace std; // Use standard namespace

int main() {         // Main function, program starts here
    cout << "Hello, World!" << endl; // Print message
    return 0;        // Return 0 to indicate successful execution
}
